The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose;

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where background is a light colour
- The light buttons are for dark background areas and banners where the background is an image-replacement.

Feel free to mix with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
